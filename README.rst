.. <!-- intro content start -->

``tesscube`` is a package designed to help you obtain TESS data by cutting it out of the FFI cubes at the `Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) <https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html>`_.

``tesscube`` works with data that is available in the cloud, and will return TESS data in formats similar to the NASA TESS official mission products. You do not need any login credentials to use `tesscube`, and can use this tool by pip installing either on your local machine or in the cloud.

.. note:: Data formats
  `tesscube` will return `astropy` native objects, including `astropy.fits.HDUList` objects, and `astropy.wcs.WCS` objects. You can work with these directly, or load them into `lightkurve`.

Quickstart
==========

The easiest way to install ``tesscube`` and all of its dependencies is to use the ``pip`` command.

To install ``tesscube``, run the following command in a terminal window:

.. code-block:: console

  $ python -m pip install tesscube --upgrade

The ``--upgrade`` flag is optional, but recommended if you already
have ``tesscube`` installed and want to upgrade to the latest version.

Depending on the specific Python environment, you may need to replace ``python``
with the correct Python interpreter, e.g., ``python3``.

Load an FFI cube
----------------

You can work with an FFI cube by loading it using a sector, camera, and CCD number.

.. code-block:: python

  from tesscube import TESSCube
  cube = TESSCube(sector=1, camera=1, ccd=4)


Obtain an FFI Using `tesscube`
------------------------------

You can obtain an FFI image by indexing into a cube

.. code-block:: python

  from tesscube import TESSCube
  cube = TESSCube(sector=1, camera=1, ccd=4)
  ffi = cube[300]

This will return an `astropy.fits.HDUList`


Obtain a TPF
------------

You can obtain a TPF in two ways, either you can either pass a pixel position

.. code-block:: python

  from tesscube import TESSCube
  from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
  corner = (1282, 1750)
  cube = TESSCube(sector=1, camera=1, ccd=4)
  tpf = cube.get_tpf(corner, shape=(10, 11))

Or you can pass an astropy SkyCoord object containing the RA and Dec of the target

.. code-block:: python

  from tesscube import TESSCube
  from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
  coord = SkyCoord.from_name("AU Mic")
  cube = TESSCube(sector=1, camera=1, ccd=4)
  tpf = cube.get_tpf(coord, shape=(10, 11))

Alternatively, you can index into the cube like so:

.. code-block:: python

  from tesscube import TESSCube
  cube = TESSCube(sector=1, camera=1, ccd=4)
  tpf = cube[:, 401:410, 503:510]

Both will return an `astropy.fits.HDUList`, with a file format similar to the official mission products.

Obtain a lower time resolution TPF
----------------------------------

You can obtain a lower time resolution by either passing in a `frame_bin` parameter, which will downsample the resultant TPF,

.. code-block:: python

  from tesscube import TESSCube
  from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
  corner = (1282, 1750)
  cube = TESSCube(sector=1, camera=1, ccd=4)
  tpf = cube.get_tpf(corner, shape=(10, 11), frame_bin=10)

Or you can slice the cube, which will return a downsampled TPF


.. code-block:: python
  
  from tesscube import TESSCube
  cube = TESSCube(sector=1, camera=1, ccd=4)
  tpf = cube[::10, 401:410, 503:510]

Both will return an `astropy.fits.HDUList`, with a file format similar to the official mission products, with the time resolution reduced by a factor of 10.
